				<h2>Experienced Bridgeport Shoplifting Defense Lawyers</h2>
				<p>Shoplifting is an offense that can range widely in scope and severity. The type and level of offense will be based upon the value of the property taken and surrounding circumstances such as the use of a weapon. Some shoplifting and petty theft is organized and done for economic gain. Some is done for the psychological benefits. Some shoplifting is simply an accident or misunderstanding that involves otherwise law-abiding citizens. </p>
