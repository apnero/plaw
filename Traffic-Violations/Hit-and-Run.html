<h2>What Are the Penalties for Hit-and-Run in Connecticut?</h2>
<p>Connecticut's hit-and-run law, known as the &quot;evading responsibility&quot; law, holds drivers accountable when they know they have been involved in an accident causing injury or death and fail to: 1) render assistance; and 2) provide their name, address, license number, registration information and other details. </p>
<p>Leaving the scene of an accident causing serious injury or death is a felony crime that can lead to up to $10,000 in fines, one to 10 years in prison, one- to five-year driver's license suspension, and a felony criminal record. </p>
<p>If the accident you were involved in caused less serious injuries and/or property damage, you can still face substantial charges and penalties, including up to one year imprisonment, a fine and 90-day driver's license suspension. </p>
<h2>A Hit-and-Run Charge Doesn't Mean Conviction</h2>
