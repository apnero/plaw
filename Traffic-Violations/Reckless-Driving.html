<p>Some traffic tickets are more serious than others. For example, a speeding ticket can result in a fine and higher insurance rates. If you have multiple tickets, you may even lose your driver's license for a period of time. If you are charged with reckless driving, however, the consequences are much higher. Now you face suspension of your license and a jail sentence of up to 30 days for a first offense. For a second offense, you can be sent to jail for up to one year.</p><p>Since 1990, Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, has defended people charged with a variety of traffic crimes in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and surrounding areas.
