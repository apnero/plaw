<h2>Connecticut Attorneys Defending Your Driving Privileges</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">If you received a traffic ticket, it may seem easier to simply pay your fine. However, pleading guilty to a traffic violation has hidden costs beyond the amount of the fine. To protect your rights and driving privileges, you should first consult with an experienced criminal defense attorney.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Since 1990, Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, Attorneys at Law has defended clients charged with a variety of traffic crimes in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and surrounding areas. We believe in making the state prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and seek to minimize the consequences you face.</p>
<h3>Protecting You From Hidden Costs</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">Depending on the nature of your alleged traffic offense, you could be required to appear in traffic court as well as criminal court. If convicted in either, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will assess points against your license, and conviction in either court may increase your insurance premiums. Depending on the number of points or convictions you have, you could also have your license suspended.</p>
<p class="callOut" style="text-align:justify">We understand that your driving privileges are central to your daily life. If your license has been suspended, we can work to obtain a temporary driving permit so you can get to work or school while we work on your case. Contact us to learn more.</p>
