<h3>Charged With Minor in Possession of Alcohol (MIP)?</h3>
<p>The charge for possession of alcohol by a minor can be found under Connecticut General Statutes Section 30-89. If your child were to plead guilty, he or she is facing fines and a mandatory driver's license suspension. While it may be tempting to just send in the money for the fine and think it will go away, it is not that simple. A second charge could lead to even more problems and consequences down the road. Do not risk that by riding this off as &quot;just a ticket.&quot; Take serious legal defense action to avoid serious penalties later on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he or she will likely see his or her auto insurance premiums go up. It is imperative that you take this charge seriously and seek the advice of a seasoned criminal defense law firm.</p>
