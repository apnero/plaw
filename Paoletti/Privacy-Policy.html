<p>This privacy policy applies to information collected online  from users of this website. In this policy, you can learn what kind of  information we collect, when and how we might use that information, how we  protect the information, and the choices you have with respect to your personal  information.</p>
<h3>What personal information is collected through this website  and how is it used?</h3>
<p>We collect information  about our users in three ways: directly  from the user, from our Web server logs and through cookies. We use the  information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience  that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant  and helpful to you. We don't share any of the information you provide with  others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good  faith that the law requires it.</p>
<p><strong>User-supplied information</strong>: If you fill out the contact form on this  website, we will ask you to provide some personal information (such as e-mail  address, name, phone number and state). We only require that you provide an e-mail address on the contact form. Further,  if chat is available through this site, you may be asked to provide information  if you participate in an online chat. Please do not submit any confidential,  proprietary or sensitive personally identifiable information (e.g. Social  Security Number; date of birth; drivers license number; or credit card, bank  account or other financial information) (collectively, &ldquo;Sensitive  Information&rdquo;). If you submit any Sensitive Information, you do so at your own  risk and we will not be liable to you or responsible for consequences of your  submission.</p>
<p>Information that you  provide to us through the contact form or an online chat will be used so that we  may respond to your inquiry. We may also use information you provide to us to  communicate with you in the future. If you do not wish to receive such  communications, you may opt out (unsubscribe) as described below.</p>
<p><strong>Web server logs</strong>: When you visit our  website, we may track information about your visit and store that information  in web server logs, which are records of the activities on our sites. The servers  automatically capture and save the information electronically. Examples of the  information we may collect include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>your unique Internet protocol address; </li>
	<li>the name of your unique Internet service provider; </li>
	<li>the town/city, county/state and country from which you access our website; </li>
	<li>the kind of browser or computer you use; </li>
	<li>the number of links you click within the site; </li>
	<li>the date and time of your visit; </li>
	<li>the web page from which you arrived to our site; </li>
	<li>the pages you viewed on the site; and </li>
	<li>certain searches/queries that you conducted via our website(s). </li>
</ul>
<p>The  information we collect in web server logs helps us administer the site, analyze  its usage, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use and  improve the user's experience.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> In order to offer and  provide a customized and personal service, our websites and applications may  use cookies to store and help track information about you. Cookies are simply  small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored  on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help remind us who you are and  to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save  passwords and preferences for you so you won't have to re-enter them each time  you visit.</p>
<p>The  use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to  accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify  you when you receive a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should  understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you  don't accept cookies.</p>
<h3>How is personal information protected?</h3>
<p>We take certain appropriate  security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental  loss and from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, we cannot  guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security  measures.</p>
<h3>Who has access to the information?</h3>
<p>We  will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other user data to others, and  we will not make your personal information available to any unaffiliated  parties, except as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>to agents, website vendors and/or contractors who may use it on our behalf or in connection with their relationship with us; </li>
	<li>if we are unable to assist with your matter, but know an unaffiliated attorney or firm that may be able to help you, we may refer you and share information you provided us with that party; and </li>
	<li>as required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another firm or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How can I correct, amend or  delete my personal information and/or opt out of future communications?</h3>
<p>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any  time. Contact us via the phone number,  contact form or mailing address on our website at any time to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>see what data we have about you, if any;</li>
	<li>change/correct any data we have about you;</li>
	<li>ask us to delete any data we have about you; and/or</li>
	<li>opt out of future communications from us.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this  privacy policy, please contact us via the phone number, contact form or mailing  address listed on this website. If our information practices change in a  significant way, we will post the policy changes here.</p>
