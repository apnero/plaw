<h2>Experienced Bridgeport DUI/DWI Defense Attorney</h2>
<p>If you were stopped for suspected drunk driving, you may have been asked to submit to a Breathalyzer test or field sobriety tests. The outcomes of these tests, however, do not automatically confirm that you are guilty. To protect your rights and interests, you should contact a skilled DUI defense attorney.</p>
<p>At Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, we defend individuals accused of
<a href="/DUI-DWI/DUI-DWI.html">DUI/DWI</a> in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and surrounding areas. With more than 50 years of combined trial experience, our attorneys use creative discovery techniques to ensure your rights are protected.
</p>
<h3>We Explore All the Options</h3>
<p>In Connecticut, you are considered legally intoxicated if your blood alcohol content is .08 or higher. If you're under 21, that number lowers to .02. Refusing a Breathalyzer carries certain mandatory penalties, including temporary
<a href="License-Suspension.html">license suspension</a>. Conviction, however, could mean fines of up to $1,000, six months in jail, community service and license suspension for a year. These penalties only increase with repeat offenses.
</p>
<p>As
<a href="/Paoletti/Attorneys.html">experienced trial attorneys</a>, we know that many issues could affect Breathalyzer test results or your ability to perform field sobriety tests. We investigate every detail of your case, making sure that:
</p>
<ul><li>The Breathalyzer machine was properly calibrated</li><li>The machine used was certified and serviced regularly</li><li>Field sobriety tests were administered under proper conditions (on a flat surface, etc.)</li></ul>
<p>We explore every possible explanation, which could cause a false positive reading. Perhaps a recent injury or illness prevented you from understanding instructions or performing certain tests. Perhaps your medication affected Breathalyzer results. We have seen it all and will defend your interests in state or federal court if needed.</p>
