<h2>Connecticut House Arrest &amp; Electronic Monitoring</h2><p style="text-align:justify">In some cases where a person arrested for a crime would ordinarily face jail, it may be possible for an attorney to work out an arrangement that involves house arrest and electronic monitoring.

Other than those exceptions, the person must remain within the premises. An electronic bracelet may be used to track that person's whereabouts and activities. A failure to remain on the premises, or to otherwise violate the house arrest, will constitute a violation that results in incarceration.</p><p style="text-align:justify">For most people, house arrest and electronic monitoring is a preferable option. Not only does the convicted individual get to avoid incarceration, but he or she is still allowed to maintain a job or pursue education while satisfying a criminal sentence. There is typically a cost involved in a house arrest program with electronic monitoring.</p><h3>Contact Us for House Arrest &amp; Electronic Monitoring Information</h3><p style="text-align:justify">For more information regarding house arrest and electronic monitoring in Connecticut, <a href="/Paoletti/Contact.html">contact our firm</a> by calling 203-583-8585.
