The first process involves the status of your driving privileges, which will be handled by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ct.gov/dmv/site/default.asp">Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)</a>. After a first offense charge, you have seven days from the date of the arrest to schedule an administrative hearing with the DMV. The failure to schedule this hearing will result in the suspension of your license being upheld.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The second process involves the actual criminal case, which will determine guilt or innocence under the law. You can be found not guilty of a first offense DUI and still have your license suspended through the DMV process.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Our Bridgeport DUI attorneys have extensive experience representing individuals in criminal and DMV Per Se hearings.
