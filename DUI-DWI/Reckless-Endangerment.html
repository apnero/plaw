<p>Reckless endangerment is a crime that can be charged separately or as an add-on to other criminal charges. For example, it is possible to be charged with reckless endangerment for drunk driving, or for failing to prevent someone else from drunk driving. While reckless endangerment is a misdemeanor crime in Connecticut, it should not be ignored. </p>
<p>Reckless endangerment in the first degree is a Class A misdemeanor, which carries up to one year in prison and $2,000 in fines. Reckless endangerment in the second degree is a Class B misdemeanor, which carries up to six months in prison and $1,000 in fines. In addition to the specific penalties, a conviction gives you a criminal record, which can affect your chances of finding employment, purchasing a gun or even obtaining a student loan. </p>

<h2>What Is Reckless Endangerment?</h2>
<p>There are two degrees of reckless endangerment:</p>
<ol><li>
<strong>Reckless endangerment in the first degree: </strong>You can be charged with first-degree reckless endangerment in Connecticut if you recklessly, and with extreme indifference to human life, act in a way that creates a risk of serious physical harm to someone else.
</li><li>
<strong>Reckless endangerment in the second degree: </strong>You can be charged with second-degree reckless endangerment in Connecticut if you recklessly engage in conduct that could cause physical injury to someone else.
</li></ol>
<p>The difference between the two charges lies in the extent of the recklessness (was the defendant acting in a way that showed he or she did not care about another's life?) and the potential damage (was there a substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of health?). Note, however, that you do not actually have to cause an injury to be charged with either degree of reckless endangerment.</p>
<h2>Why Was I Charged With Reckless Endangerment?</h2>
<p>Reckless endangerment is a unique criminal offense that can be charged along with any number of alleged crimes, including:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="/DUI-DWI/DUI-DWI.html">Drunk driving</a>
</li><li>
<a href="/Traffic-Violations/Traffic-Violations.html">Traffic offenses</a> such as reckless driving
</li><li>
<a href="/Domestic-Violence/Domestic-Violence.html">Domestic violence</a>
</li><li>
<a href="/Violent-Crimes/Violent-Crimes.html">Violent crimes</a>
</li></ul>
<p>Yet, what is perhaps more confusing is that reckless endangerment charges often attach to actions that are less directly related to the risk of injuries and death. For example, teenagers have been charged with reckless endangerment for letting their friends drive drunk and parents have been charged with reckless endangerment for allowing underage drinking parties to be held in their homes.</p>
