<p>While some motor vehicle offenses, such as DUIs, are charged as misdemeanors and a felony for subsequent convictions, vehicular assault is serious enough to be charged as a felony in Connecticut.

Experienced criminal defense is critical if you have been arrested for vehicular assault. </p>

<h2>Bridgeport Vehicular Assault Defense Lawyers</h2>
