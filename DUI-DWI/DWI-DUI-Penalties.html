<p>If you are found guilty in a criminal case for drunk driving in the state of Connecticut, there are significant penalties that you may face as a result, including the license suspension and a mark on your criminal record.

Rejecting a chemical test carries a mandatory license suspension.</p><p>If you did not refuse a Breathalyzer or other chemical test, you may still face mandatory alcohol education and treatment, license suspension or revocation, and the installation of an ignition interlock system. In Connecticut, for a first offense, there is a mandatory suspension of no less than 90 days. Jail time for a first offense is unlikely, but for a subsequent offense or in other circumstances with a BAC higher than .15 or where a child is present in the vehicle, there is a greater possibility of incarceration.</p><h2>Connecticut DUI Penalties</h2><p><strong>Table 1: DUI Criminal Penalties (CGS Ǡ227a (g))</strong></p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th><strong><em>Conviction</em></strong></th><th><strong><em>Prison Sentence</em></strong></th><th><strong><em>Fine</em></strong></th><th><strong><em>License Suspension</em></strong></th></tr><tr><td valign="top">First</td><td align="justify" valign="top">Either (1) up to six months with a mandatory minimum of two days or (2) up to six months suspended with probation requiring 100 hours of community service</td><td align="justify" valign="top">$500- $1,000</td><td align="justify" valign="top">45 days, followed by one year driving only a vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock.</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" valign="top">Second (Under Age 21)</td><td align="justify" valign="top">Up to two years, with a mandatory minimum of 120 consecutive days and probation with 100 hours community service</td><td align="justify" valign="top">$1,000- $4,000</td><td align="justify" valign="top">45 days or until age 21,* whichever is longer, followed by three years of driving only a vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock, with operation for the first year limited to travel to or from work, school, an alcohol or drug abuse treatment program, or ignition interlock service center.</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" valign="top">Second (Age 21 or older)</td><td align="justify" valign="top">Up to two years, with a mandatory minimum of 120 consecutive days and probation with 100 hours community service</td><td align="justify" valign="top">$1,000- $4,000</td><td align="justify" valign="top">45 days, followed by three years of driving only a vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock, with operation for the first year limited to travel to or from work, school, an alcohol or drug abuse treatment program, or ignition interlock service center.</td></tr><tr><td align="justify" valign="top">Third and Subsequent</td><td align="justify" valign="top">Up to three years, with mandatory minimum of one year and probation with 100 hours community service</td><td align="justify" valign="top">$2,000- $8,000</td><td align="justify" valign="top">
