<p>If you have been arrested for a DUI in Connecticut, one of the penalties upon a conviction may be the installation of an ignition interlock system. This mechanism is installed on a vehicle's dashboard, and before the motor can be started, the driver must first exhale into the device. If the resultant alcohol concentration in the breath is greater than the programmed BAC נwhich is usually .02 percent or .04 percent נthe device will prevent the engine from being started.</p>
