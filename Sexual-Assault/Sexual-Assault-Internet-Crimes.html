					<h2>Defense Attorneys for Those Charged with Sexual Assault</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The consequences of being convicted of a sex crime extend beyond just jail time. You could also be required to register as a sex offender and face social stigmas for years afterward. Therefore, if you are charged with sexual assault or 
					<a href="/Internet-Crimes/Internet-Crimes.html">other sex crimes</a>, you should contact an experienced criminal defense attorney.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">At Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, we understand the negative impact an arrest for sexual assault can have on your relationships with family, friends and the community. Our Connecticut sexual assault defense lawyers provide aggressive defense to protect your rights and pursue your best interests.</p>
				<p class="callOut" style="text-align: justify;">If you learn that you are under investigation for sexual assault, call our office in Bridgeport at 203-371-1000 to schedule a 
					<strong>free initial consultation.</strong>
				</p>
				<h3>You Have a Right to Remain Silent</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone who is accused of a crime has the 
					<a href="/Criminal-Defense/What-to-Do-if-You-Are-Arrested.html">right to remain silent</a> when contacted by police. At no time is this right more important than if you are accused of a sex crime. Even statements explaining your innocence can be twisted around and used as evidence against you.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Our lawyers will interview witnesses, review police reports and thoroughly examine all evidence in your case, including the background of the alleged victim. Our goal in any sexual assault case is to persuade prosecutors not to charge you with a crime. If that is not possible, we will build a strong defense that counters the state's evidence.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">We are experienced in defending cases involving sexual assault of a minor, incest, child sex abuse, date rape, statutory rape and other types of sexual assault cases.</p>
