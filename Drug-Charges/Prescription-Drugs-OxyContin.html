<h2>Bridgeport OxyContin Sales and Prescription Drug Crimes Defense Attorneys</h2>
<p>Many people who are arrested for prescription drug fraud did not intend to break the law. After a surgical procedure or an illness where painkillers are prescribed, such as OxyContin or Vicodin, a patient may become addicted to the medication. Once the initial prescription runs out, that person may forge or fake prescriptions in order to obtain more of the drug.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, forging or altering a prescription is a criminal offense that can have a significant long-term impact on a person's life. A person who is trying to sell or distribute prescription drugs can face increased penalties, including jail time and a permanent criminal record that will limit opportunities for employment and education.</p>
