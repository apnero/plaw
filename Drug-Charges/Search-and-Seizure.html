					<p>In many drug cases, much of the prosecution's case resolves around the seizure of drugs, paraphernalia and other evidence. This evidence is used to demonstrate criminal activity. If this evidence was obtained unlawfully, or in a manner that violates the constitutional rights of the suspect, the government should not be able to use that evidence. An experienced attorney can challenge law enforcement's search and seizure of a vehicle, home or person.</p>
				<p>The skilled attorneys of

				<h2>Experienced Bridgeport Drug Crimes Defense Attorneys</h2>
				<p>The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects individuals from illegal searches and seizures by law enforcement officials. It is intended to stop overzealous investigations and prosecutions that put suspects at a disadvantage. Violations of the Fourth Amendment should not be tolerated and we believe in challenging the validity of evidence obtained through unlawful search and seizure.</p>
				<p>These challenges are made through motions to suppress of exclude the evidence and to challenge the credibility of that evidence and/or how it was obtained. We will investigate search warrant issues, wiretap evidence and know how to review whether those methods were used properly and legally.</p>
