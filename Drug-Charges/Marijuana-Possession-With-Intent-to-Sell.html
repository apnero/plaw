<p>An arrest for the possession of marijuana is a serious charge, but when there is evidence of a larger amount of drugs than would be expected for personal use, it may be deemed possession with intent to sell. Other indicators of drug sales, such as scales or plastic bags, may also result in a charge of possession with intent to sell. This offense carries significant penalties, including fines and a mandatory minimum jail sentence upon a conviction.</p>

<h2>Bridgeport Drug Sales Defense Attorney</h2>
<p>Charges of intent to sell or distribute drugs are far more serious than simple possession charges. Prosecutors will often decide what criminal charges to bring based on the amount of drugs found in your possession. Our attorneys have experience handling drug cases involving sale and distribution of marijuana, including both state and federal drug charges. We will thoroughly investigate the alleged facts of the case, review the evidence and seek to defeat the charges or mitigate the penalties in your case.</p>
<p>Drug possession with intent to sell will often involve a search of the defendant's car or home. It is during these searches that drugs and drug paraphernalia are seized. Police officers have a duty to respect search and seizure laws when gathering this evidence, however, and we will challenge any evidence that was illegally obtained. Our attorneys are heavily involved in all aspects of your case, and keep you up to date on all developments as they happen.</p>
