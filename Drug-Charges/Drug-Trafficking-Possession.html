<h2>Protecting Your Rights Against Drug Trafficking Charges</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Drug trafficking is a serious
<a href="Federal-Drug-Crimes.html">federal drug offense</a> and often aggressively prosecuted by the government. If you are facing federal charges for drug trafficking, you should contact a criminal defense attorney with experience in federal court.
</p>

<a href="/Drug-Charges/Drug-Charges.html">drug crimes</a> in both state and federal courts.

Our goal is to minimize the penalties you face by providing effective, aggressive legal defense.

<h3>Aggressively Defending Your Rights</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">Being charged with drug trafficking as opposed to possession is mostly determined by the quantity of drugs involved. It also usually involves the transfer of drugs such as
<a href="Marijuana-Possession-With-Intent-to-Sell.html">marijuana</a>, cocaine or
<a href="Heroin-Possession-With-Intent-to-Sell.html">heroin</a>. Regardless, the penalties for trafficking could involve greater fines, longer or mandatory jail sentences and more.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">There are only a limited number of attorneys who represent individuals before the federal district court. Both of our drug trafficking defense attorneys are admitted to practice before the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ctd.uscourts.gov/">Federal District Court of Connecticut</a> as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court. We have extensive trial experience and use our resources to defend your rights and interests.
</p>
<p>As experienced trial lawyers, we understand that the outcomes of your case can significantly impact your daily life, both now and in the future. We thoroughly examine all the evidence involved in your case to ensure:</p>
<ul><li>Police had probable cause to stop or arrest you in the first place</li><li>Your rights were protected by law enforcement authorities both during and after arrest</li><li>Physical evidence was legally obtained</li></ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">We are not afraid to challenge police reports and other evidence when necessary, and aggressively defend your rights in court. Whatever the circumstances, we do what it takes to achieve the best possible outcome in the most efficient, cost-effective manner possible.</p>
