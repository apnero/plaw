<h2 style="text-align:justify">Legal Defense for Drug Offenses Involving Cocaine</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">When evidence is present of a large amount of cocaine or other drugs, it may be deemed possession with intent to sell. This evidence may include scales, plastic bags or larger amounts of drugs than would be expected for personal use. An arrest for the
<a href="Crack-Cocaine-Possession.html">possession of cocaine</a> comes with its own significant penalties, but possession with intent to sell can have increase fines and prison time.

<h3>A Defense Strategy for Cocaine Possession with Intent to Sell</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our lawyers will develop a criminal defense strategy that involves an intensive investigation to review all evidence. Drug possession with intent to sell will often involve a
<a href="Search-and-Seizure.html">search of the defendant's car or home</a>. It is during these searches that drugs and drug paraphernalia are seized. Police officers have a duty to respect search and seizure laws when gathering this evidence, however, and we will challenge any evidence that was illegally obtained.
