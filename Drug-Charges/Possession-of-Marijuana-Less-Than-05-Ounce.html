<p>Connecticut recently signed into law a bill that decriminalized the possession of less than half an ounce of marijuana. Governor Dan Malloy signed the bill into law on June 30, 2011, and the new law was in place the next day. The law removes criminal penalties for the use or possession of marijuana of less than half an ounce and for the possession of marijuana paraphernalia. It lowered the penalty from a misdemeanor to a violation and an infraction respectfully.</p>

<h2>Experienced Connecticut Drug Possession Defense</h2>
<p>Instead of facing up to a year in jail and fines of up to $1,000 for the possession of a small amount of marijuana, first-time offenders are cited and assessed a $150 fine. Subsequent offenses are subjected to increased fines of up to $500. Upon a third offense, the offender may be referred to a drug awareness program. A person under 21 who is found possessing less than a half-ounce of marijuana may also face a 60-day suspension of his or her driver's license. A driver's license suspension may trigger a higher insurance premium or cancellation of coverage.</p>
<p>The most beneficial aspect for a person who is cited for the possession of a small amount of marijuana is that he or she will no longer be arrested or saddled with a criminal record. However, this conviction will remain on your record for years to come and can still have an effect on future employment, especially in states where possession of marijuana is still a crime, as it is with Federal Law. </p>
