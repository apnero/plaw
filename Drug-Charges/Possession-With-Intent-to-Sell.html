					<h2>Fighting Against Serious Drug Charges in Connecticut</h2>
				<p>If you are convicted of drug possession with intent to sell, you could serve jail time in addition to other serious penalties, depending on the amount of the drugs intended for sale. To protect your rights and interests, you should contact an experienced criminal drug defense attorney as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>The skilled attorneys of Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, Attorneys at Law have more than 50 years of combined trial experience handing a wide variety of 
					<a href="/Drug-Charges/Drug-Charges.html">drug crimes</a>. From our office in Bridgeport, we represent individuals accused of drug offenses in state and federal courts throughout Connecticut. Our goal is to minimize the penalties you face based on the facts of your case.
				</p>
				<h3>Protecting You Against Serious Penalties</h3>
				<p>Penalties for selling or distributing drugs like marijuana, heroin or cocaine depend on the allegations and charges of the alleged sale. Factors such as the quantity of drugs involved as well as your location at the time of arrest could significantly affect possible consequences. For example, penalties may increase if you are within 1,500 feet of a school.</p>
				<p class="callOut">Drug dealers who are not drug dependent risk more severe penalties if convicted. Contact us to learn more about how we can defend your rights and interests.</p>
				<p>We believe in making the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. We use creative discovery techniques and examine all the evidence, asking questions such as:</p>
				<ul><li>Did the police have probable cause to stop you in the first place?</li><li>Did law enforcement officers have the legal authority to search your home, your car or your person at the time of arrest?</li><li>Were your rights violated in any way during or after arrest?</li><li>Was there anyone else involved or in charge of the sale? Should anyone else be held responsible for the drugs?</li><li>Can the state prove you were in possession?</li></ul>
				<p>We are not afraid to challenge police reports or evidence obtained through illegal search and seizure. While past 
					<a href="/Paoletti/Case-Results.html">case results</a> are no guarantee of future outcomes, 
					<a href="/Attorneys/Attorneys.html">our lawyers</a> have often successfully defended clients against serious drug charges.
