<a href="Restraining-Orders.html">restraining orders</a> and
<a href="Protective-Orders.html">protective orders</a>. Drawing on more than 50 years of trial experience, we seek to defend your rights, your family and your reputation.

<p style="text-align:justify">Many people do not understand their legal rights when facing domestic violence charges. We explain your options upfront in clear terms so you know what to expect. We will listen to your side of the story carefully and investigate:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify"><li>The history of your relationship</li><li>Stress factors that could have caused the incident such as money troubles or divorce</li><li>Evidence of drug or alcohol abuse</li></ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">We are not afraid to challenge police reports or possible witness statements, and explore every option, including alternatives to incarceration or special programs. Whatever your circumstances, our goal is to minimize the charges against you to prevent the stigma of a domestic violence conviction.</p>
<h3>Understanding Protective Orders</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">If your case results in a protective order being put in place, it is imperative that you understand what you can and cannot do. Even simply calling or texting your spouse or partner can be considered a violation of this order, as well as a form of
<a href="Stalking-Threatening-Harassment.html">stalking, threatening or harassment</a>. We will help you understand your rights while we work efficiently to resolve your case.
</p>
<h3>Can My Spouse or Partner Drop the Charges?</h3>
