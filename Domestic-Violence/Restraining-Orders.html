<p style="text-align:justify">In the state of Connecticut, there is a difference between restraining orders and protective orders. <a href="Protective-Orders.html">Protective orders</a> are issued in situations involving family violence where a person has been arrested for domestic violence. A restraining order, on the other hand, is a civil matter and can be issued without the accused being arrested. Both restraining orders and protective orders, however, are very serious matters.</p><p style="text-align:justify">With more than 50 years of combined trial experience, the attorneys of Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, advocate for individuals accused of <a href="/Domestic-Violence/Domestic-Violence.html">domestic violence</a>, <a href="Stalking-Threatening-Harassment.html">stalking or harassment</a> and other crimes throughout the Bridgeport, Connecticut, area.
