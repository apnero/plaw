					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Defense for Stalking, Threatening or Harassment Charges</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are involved in a domestic dispute, contacting your spouse or significant other can often be considered a form of stalking, threatening or harassment, especially if there is a protective order or restraining order in place. Therefore, to protect yourself from unfair restrictions or false allegation, you should consult with an experienced 
					<a href="/Criminal-Defense/Criminal-Defense.html">criminal defense </a>attorney right away.

				<h3>How to Protect Yourself From False Allegations</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">If you've had a 
					<a href="/Domestic-Violence/Protective-Orders.html">protective order</a> or 
					<a href="/Domestic-Violence/Restraining-Orders.html">restraining order</a> placed against you, you must take steps to protect yourself from further consequences. Unfortunately, some people try to use protective orders to their own advantage by baiting the other person. To protect yourself from such tactics, there are several things you can do:
				</p>
				<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Keep a journal and record your whereabouts and the time you spend in a particular location</li><li>Take notes while conversing with people over the phone</li><li>Keep all e-mails, texts, cell phone records and other documentary evidence</li><li>Ask your friends to keep track of the times you spend together, noting your activities and times of day</li></ul>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Above, the most important thing you can do is avoid contact with the person who has put the protective order in place. Even if he or she wishes to drop the order, the court must approve before any contact can take place.</p>
