				<h3>Protecting Your Rights</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">When a restraining order or protective order is in place, any form of contact with your spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend could be considered a violation. Depending on the terms of the order, this could prevent you from:</p>
				<ul><li>Returning home</li><li>Calling or texting your spouse or partner</li><li>Sending e-mails to your spouse or partner</li><li>Spending time with your children</li><li>Meeting with your spouse or partner at any time</li><li>Possessing firearms and gun permits</li></ul>

				<h3>Difference Between Protective Orders and Restraining Orders</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Connecticut state law, protective orders are issued in family violence situations in which either spouse has been arrested for domestic abuse. On the other hand, a restraining order is a civil matter and can be issued without the accused being arrested. However, both are equally very serious.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Violating a restraining order or a protective orders can be considered a form of 
					<a href="/Domestic-Violence/Stalking-Threatening-Harassment.html">stalking, threatening or harassment</a>. We will help you understand your rights in both situations and work diligently to resolve your issue in the most efficient, cost-effective manner possible.
