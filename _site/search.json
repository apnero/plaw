After all, you have been through a lot and the idea of fighting for a fair compensation award adds to the stress. But what if you need more than what your insurance company is offering you? Is it worth risking your future financial stability by throwing in the towel now? No. In fact, by working with an experienced car accident lawyer, you may be able to recover significantly more compensation than the insurance company wants to offer you. Remember: the insurance company cares about its bottom line. We care about yours. We are Paoletti & Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. We have more than five decades of trial experience נexperience we use to get clients fair results after serious car accidents. Call 203-371-1000 for a no-cost, no-obligation consultation today. What Is \"Fair Compensation\" in a Car Accident Case? In any auto accident case , fair compensation goes far beyond payment for your existing medical bills. Depending on the facts of your case, you may be able to receive money for a wide range of damages, including: Past, current and future medical bills related to the accident. Will you need to undergo multiple surgeries after your accident? Will you need rehabilitation or physical therapy? Did you ride in an ambulance? The payment you receive for your medical bills should cover future expenses in addition to the medical bills you have today. We will help you get the compensation you need to get appropriate medical care. Income loss. Serious injuries or the loss of a loved one can cause a family to lose much-needed income, either permanently or temporarily. Your personal injury settlement or verdict should take this financial loss into account. Pain and suffering. Have you suffered significant stress as a result of your accident? Part of a personal injury lawsuit involves putting a monetary value on your emotional pain and suffering. Permanent injury/disability . If you were permanently injured or disabled, you may be able to recover compensation specifically for your loss. Punitive damages. If you were injured by a reckless, distracted or drunk driver, you may be able to recover additional compensation from that driver that specifically punishes him or her for the poor decision that caused you harm. What Compensation Is Available to You After a Car Crash? To recover fair compensation, however, you must know both what compensation is possible and what is available. If, for example, the other driver only carried the minimum necessary bodily injury liability insurance coverage in Connecticut and you were seriously injured, chances are that insurance will not cover all of your injuries. If the driver him/herself does not have additional compensation for you, you may need to look to your own uninsured/underinsured driver's policy. We will look to all possible means of recovery to seek the maximum amount of compensation possible in your claim.

Protecting You From Severe Consequences If you have been charged with possession of child pornography, you are in a fight for your life. Possession of child pornography is often charged in federal court, where sentencing guidelines call for a minimum of five years in prison. Depending on the number of images alleged to be in your possession and whether you are charged with production, you could face a much longer sentence. Even if you are charged in state court and are offered probation, you face the risk of lifetime registration as a sex offender. The early involvement of an experienced defense attorney is essential to protect you from devastating consequences. There are many defenses in child pornography cases. Here are some examples: The images are not pornography. The images were downloaded on your computer by another person. The images were inadvertently downloaded after you clicked on a deceptive link. Many young people face child pornography charges for images on cellphones. If you are accused of possessing images on your cellphone, it's important to talk to an experienced lawyer before you talk to police to avoid self-incrimination.

The reality is that passengers may suffer the same types of injuries as drivers in motor vehicle accidents. This includes: Head injuries: Front seat passengers may hit their heads on the dashboard and suffer head injuries or brain damage. Passengers' heads may also collide with windows. Spine injuries: After a rear-end collision or another type of auto collision, passengers may suffer back injuries that include damage to the spinal cord. Broken bones: Passengers riding anywhere in a car may suffer broken arms from attempting to reach out and brace themselves for the impact. Broken legs and other broken bones are common as well after auto accidents. Who Caused The Injuries To The Passenger? If the car accident was caused by the negligent driver of another vehicle, legal action will target that driver. However, in some cases, the driver of the vehicle the passenger was in may have caused the accident or contributed to the accident. This may be a friend or family member, so the victim may be hesitant to move forward with legal action. It is important to understand that the true target of legal action is the driver's insurance company. Depending on the nature of the car accident, legal action may target both drivers. Ultimately, our lawyers are committed to getting fair compensation for the passenger victim.

Connecticut Expungement Process In Connecticut, the expungement process allows you to seal records related to criminal charges so those records will not be visible to someone conducting a background check on you. If your records are expunged, you can answer \"no\" if you are asked on most employment or license applications if you have ever been charged with a crime. Criminal records can be expunged three years after sentence completion for a misdemeanor and five years after felony sentence is completed. Not all records can be expunged. Connecticut Pardon Process The Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles has discretionary authority to grant pardons for criminal convictions. A pardon is forgiveness of a crime, along with cancellation of any punishment such as a prison sentence. If you are pardoned for a crime, you can also obtain an expungement to seal records related to the charge.

Governor Dan Malloy signed the bill into law on June 30, 2011, and the new law was in place the next day.

It lowered the penalty from a misdemeanor to a violation and an infraction respectfully.

Experienced Connecticut Drug Possession Defense Instead of facing up to a year in jail and fines of up to $1,000 for the possession of a small amount of marijuana, first-time offenders are cited and assessed a $150 fine. Subsequent offenses are subjected to increased fines of up to $500. Upon a third offense, the offender may be referred to a drug awareness program. A person under 21 who is found possessing less than a half-ounce of marijuana may also face a 60-day suspension of his or her driver's license. A driver's license suspension may trigger a higher insurance premium or cancellation of coverage. The most beneficial aspect for a person who is cited for the possession of a small amount of marijuana is that he or she will no longer be arrested or saddled with a criminal record. However, this conviction will remain on your record for years to come and can still have an effect on future employment, especially in states where possession of marijuana is still a crime, as it is with Federal Law.

For example, it is possible to be charged with reckless endangerment for drunk driving, or for failing to prevent someone else from drunk driving. While reckless endangerment is a misdemeanor crime in Connecticut, it should not be ignored. Reckless endangerment in the first degree is a Class A misdemeanor, which carries up to one year in prison and $2,000 in fines. Reckless endangerment in the second degree is a Class B misdemeanor, which carries up to six months in prison and $1,000 in fines. In addition to the specific penalties, a conviction gives you a criminal record, which can affect your chances of finding employment, purchasing a gun or even obtaining a student loan. Protect your future. Preserve your freedom. Speak with an attorney experienced in reckless endangerment defense at Paoletti & Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Call 203-371-1000 for a free initial consultation. What Is Reckless Endangerment? There are two degrees of reckless endangerment: Reckless endangerment in the first degree: You can be charged with first-degree reckless endangerment in Connecticut if you recklessly, and with extreme indifference to human life, act in a way that creates a risk of serious physical harm to someone else. Reckless endangerment in the second degree: You can be charged with second-degree reckless endangerment in Connecticut if you recklessly engage in conduct that could cause physical injury to someone else. The difference between the two charges lies in the extent of the recklessness (was the defendant acting in a way that showed he or she did not care about another's life?) and the potential damage (was there a substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of health?). Note, however, that you do not actually have to cause an injury to be charged with either degree of reckless endangerment. Why Was I Charged With Reckless Endangerment? Reckless endangerment is a unique criminal offense that can be charged along with any number of alleged crimes, including: Drunk driving Traffic offenses such as reckless driving Domestic violence Violent crimes Yet, what is perhaps more confusing is that reckless endangerment charges often attach to actions that are less directly related to the risk of injuries and death. For example, teenagers have been charged with reckless endangerment for letting their friends drive drunk and parents have been charged with reckless endangerment for allowing underage drinking parties to be held in their homes.

Yet, that statistic doesn't make car accidents any less complicated. After an accident, you must get medical help, figure out what to do with your damaged car and make a claim with your insurance company. You may even need to work through the difficult emotions and financial challenges that come with serious physical injuries or the death of a loved one. The confusion, frustration, depression and anger can be overwhelming. Determining what to do next can seem like an insurmountable task. We want to help.

The answer to this question depends on your physical state and the facts surrounding your car accident. Here are five initial steps you can take to help your car accident claim: 1) Document the accident. If you are relatively unharmed, document the accident by: Taking pictures of the accident scene, including your car, the other person's car and any damage on the ground Taking down the names and numbers of any witnesses to the accident Exchanging insurance information, names, numbers and license plate numbers with the other driver(s) 2) Seek medical attention. No matter what your injuries, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. This is true even if you feel you will heal on your own. Many symptoms of potentially lifelong injuries do not appear until weeks, even months after an accident. By getting medical help now, you can start the healing process sooner and secure the compensation you need to get appropriate medical care for your injuries. 3) Call the police. No matter how much property damage or how great the injuries in a car accident, it is a good idea to call the police. They will document your accident for legal purposes נdocumentation that could help your accident claim. 4) Call your insurance company. Let your insurance company know that the accident occurred, but make sure to steer clear of any discussions about fault or how the accident happened. Insurance companies like to pry information out of people before they have the facts themselves. Answer \"who,\" \"what,\" \"where\" and \"when,\" but let your attorney investigate your accident and provide your insurance company with the \"how.\" 5) Seek legal help. Many people choose not to seek legal help after a car crash because they don't think the cost of legal representation is worth it. Yet, by talking to an attorney, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain. At Paoletti & Gusmano, we offer free consultations with no obligation to hire us. During our consultation, we will discuss your case and your options for recovering compensation. Remember: insurance companies care about their bottom lines more than your financial security. Their first settlement offers never cover the full extent of their insured's injuries. Let us help you get full and fair compensation.

Yet, many cases never make it to trial. In fact, charges are often reduced or dismissed during the early stages of the criminal defense process. How, then, does the Connecticut criminal defense system work? What can you expect to happen in your criminal defense case ? Below is an overview of the criminal defense process. To learn how your specific case may move through the process, speak with an experienced defense lawyer at Paoletti & Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, by sending an email or calling 203-371-1000. Arraignment Everyone who is arrested for a crime and held in custody, no matter how severe the crime, must appear in court the next business day after the arrest. This is called the arraignment. At arraignment, you will need to decide whether you want to plead guilty or not guilty to your criminal charges. The judge will also set your bond. Pretrial Conference If you plead not guilty to your criminal charges, your next step in the criminal defense process will be the pretrial conference. During this time, you, your attorney and the prosecutor will discuss your case and determine whether to agree to any plea deals/plea bargains. Motions to Dismiss a Case or Suppress Evidence If you do not agree to a plea deal, your trial date will be set. Between the pretrial conference and trial, your attorney may bring a motion to dismiss your case or a motion to suppress evidence. The judge will review the motions and the evidence to determine whether to dismiss the case, suppress evidence the prosecutor intends to use against you, and/or continue the case. Bench or Jury Trial If your case goes to trial, you may have a bench trial, where the judge decides your case, or a jury trial, where your case is presented before a jury of six or 12 people. During trial, both sides will have the chance to give opening arguments, present evidence, call witnesses to the stand, cross-examine witnesses and present closing arguments. You may or may not want to offer your own testimony. Choosing not to speak is a constitutional right and cannot be used against you. Once closing arguments are complete, the judge will give the jury instructions on the legal issues involved in the case. The jury will then retire to a room where they will deliberate and attempt to come to an unanimous decision. How long a trial will last depends on the amount of evidence presented and whether or not the jurors can agree on your innocence or guilt.

You could be worried about jail time, fines or losing your driver's license. While repeated convictions for driving under the influence usually mean stiff penalties, first-time offenders should not lose hope. Connecticut DUI Law Overview Connecticut law holds that driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a crime; the law will presume you were intoxicated if you registered an \"elevated\" blood alcohol content, or BAC, of 0.08 percent or more. If you are under 21, the elevated level is 0.02 percent, and for commercial motor vehicle drivers it is 0.04 percent. Keep in mind, too, regarding Connecticut drunk driving defense , that a person may be convicted of DUI even if he or she does not have a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or higher. This is because, under Connecticut law, DUI includes driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol, regardless of your BAC. In other words, DUI in Connecticut is not synonymous with blood alcohol content of 0.08 or over. You can potentially be prosecuted if you exhibit signs of being impaired, even if there was no BAC test. Administrative Penalties for DUI in Connecticut If you have a Connecticut driver's license, you are presumed to consent to a BAC test. Failing the test - blood, breath or urine - or refusing to submit to it, can result in having your driver's license suspended or even revoked. A Connecticut DUI license suspension period is greater if you refuse the test, register a BAC of 0.16 or higher, or have a prior DUI conviction. The length of your suspension will also be enhanced if you are less than 21 years old. Especially if you were 16 or 17 years old when cited for DUI, it can be difficult to get your license back. Connecticut's New Implied Consent Laws New legislation significantly changes the driver's license suspension law for people convicted of DUI, according to Connecticut's Office of Legislative Research. These punishments are separate from the criminal consequences following a DUI conviction. Starting in January 2012, the license suspension period for first and second convictions will be shortened to 45 days. Before, suspension lasted at minimum a full year, with three years of suspension if you were under 21 years old and convicted of a second DUI. As a trade-off, the new law applies ignition interlock device restrictions to drivers on their first, rather than second, DUI conviction. The period that you must drive only interlock-equipped vehicles will now be either one or three years based on whether you are 21 years and over and whether it is your first or second DUI. If you reach a third DUI, your license will be revoked, with a chance of reinstatement after six years. Criminal Penalties For a first-time DUI charge, you might be able to apply to the court for admission to an alcohol intervention or substance abuse treatment program. If you complete the program, you can apply to have the DUI charges dismissed; if unsuccessful, the criminal case will proceed. A conviction will result in either a sentence of up to six months, with a mandatory minimum of two days, or probation with 100 hours of community service. The fine is $500-$1,000. Repeat offenders can get up to two years in prison and probation with 100 hours of community service, along with a $1,000-$4,000 fine. If you are convicted of three DUI offenses or more, you could be looking at up to a three year sentence as well as probation, 100 hours of community service and a fine of up to $8,000. If you have been arrested and charged with a DUI offense, it is important to consult with an experienced criminal defense attorney. A defense lawyer will raise your available defenses and advocate on your behalf for alternatives to incarceration.

According to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control, nearly 3 of every 10 women in the US have experienced a form of what the CDC calls \"intimate partner violence.\" This includes not only rape and physical violence, but also stalking. Men can also be the victims of such violence. The CDC estimates that 1 in 10 men have experienced intimate partner violence. There is also, of course, the problem of violence against children. Such violence is a major problem, regardless of whether it is classified as child abuse. The legal system seeks to respond to domestic violence in several different ways. One of these is criminal prosecution, which is important in holding offenders accountable but is always an after-the-fact- response. By the time someone is prosecuted, harm has already been done. This is where court orders come in, to offer more proactive protection. In Connecticut, two of the main types are: Restraining orders - The goal is to protect against threatened future harm by prohibiting someone from having contact with the person who has obtained the order. These are obtained in a civil proceeding. Protective orders - Unlike restraining orders, which are civil in nature, protective orders are a possible criminal consequence when someone is arrested for a family violence crime. Arrest for Suspected \"Family Violence\" Leads to Protective Order Under Connecticut law, family violence means any \"physical harm, bodily injury or assault between family or household members.\" Even threats of physical harm fall into this definition. An officer who arrives on the scene and discovers that any of these conditions exist must arrest the suspected abusive family member. Once the accused has been arrested for the family violence crime, a court will issue the protective order. At this point, no crime has been proven, and the accused is just that: someone accused of a crime. Connecticut protective orders are legal documents whose purpose is to protect the victim from abusive behavior by the accused. The order can prohibit the accused from entering the victim's home or imposing any restraint upon the victim's person or liberty. It also can order the accused not to threaten, harass, assault, molest, or sexually assault the victim, or to have no contact with the victim. Consequences for Violating a Protective Order or Restraining Order Once charges are filed and s the accused prepares a domestic violence defense , any bail or release that the court sets will require the defendant to follow the protective order. Any failure to comply with the order, therefore, will violate the defendant's bail or release. In response, the court can revoke the defendant's release - landing the defendant back in jail - or increase the defendant's bail. Whatever kind of violence the defendant commits that violates the protective order might be a crime, so the defendant can be punished accordingly for that conduct as well. Lastly, violation of a protective order is itself a crime with severe punishments. Violating a protective order can result in imprisonment of up to five years, a fine of up to $5,000, or both. Additionally, entering the victim's home is a separate crime, criminal trespass, which can lead to up to a year of incarceration, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. It is important to remember that those accused of family violence must get notice of the charges against them and a hearing at which they can argue their case. Defendants who are subject to a protective order should contact an experienced domestic violence defense lawyer, who will evaluate the charges against them and vigorously protect their rights under the law.

Of course, the Web contains dangers as well as opportunities. Internet crimes are not an urban myth. But excessive concern about so-called predators should not lead to excessive infringement of the right to free speech and association, either. In one recent case, a woman was sexually harassed by a man she met on Match.com. It was later established that the man who was granted membership to the dating site had a long history of sexual assault crimes against women met on the Internet, crimes easily apparent with a simple search. The woman aimed to hold Match.com accountable for not checking subscribers to the site against the national sex offender registry. The woman settled the case after the company agreed to screen members against both state and federal sex offender registries. Match.com is not alone. Other online dating sites including eHarmony have agreed to increase their efforts to remove sexual predators, financial scammers and identity thieves from their sites. Dating sites are not the only ones facing scrutiny. Online gaming, Facebook and similar social networking sites are also being called to increase the security and safety of their sites with similar measures. The desire to protect members from the risk of violent crime is understandable. But using the sexual offender registry may cast too broad a net. This registry includes many offenses that would not hinder a dating pool or result in much concern about children joining a gaming session, like public urination or consensual sex with a minor girlfriend when the offender was 16 and the girlfriend 15. In addition, civil rights advocates are against use of the registry. The groups argue many of these measures unduly violate the rights of those found guilty of committing sex crimes. Debate Over Banning Sex Offenders From Using Websites Advocates for restricting access to social networking, virtual gaming and online dating sites for registered sex offenders paint a grim picture. They speculate that children are at risk for developing online relationships with convicted child molester by playing Xbox Live or forming Facebook friendships. Although the need to protect children is understandable, simply banning sex offenders from social media sites is a simplistic, flawed attempt to solve a more complex problem. The truth is, children are far more likely to be abused by a family member or other acquaintance than by a stranger met online. To be sure, it may still be wise to provide some level of protection against those with a history of abusing the Internet. Instead of implementing this broadly sweeping piece of legislation, though, it may be more effective to apply Internet restrictions on an individual basis, reviewing each case and taking into consideration past abuses of Internet resources. Legislation tailored in this manner would continue to encourage those without a history of abuse using the Internet to continue to use it for support groups and job searches. Banning Internet Access Violates Sex Offenders' Rights Many take issue with the expansive reach of prohibitions against sex offenders. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit to block enforcement of a state law in Louisiana aimed at protecting children. The law limited sex offender's use of the Internet by prohibiting \"using or accessing social networking websites, chat rooms and peer-to-peer networks.\" Even though the law included a stipulation narrowing the scope of registered sex offenders to those connected with crimes involving children, the language of the law was overly broad and infringed upon the sex offenders' constitutional rights. Essentially, ACLU argued the law made it illegal for sex offenders to access the Internet. Even sites like CNN and ESPN allow communication between users in a commentary section, thus potentially falling under either the peer-to-peer or social networking categories of restricted areas. The ACLU supports attempts to protect children from those who would do harm, but believes this type of law is unreasonable. In addition to potentially violating constitutional rights, such laws may have an unintended side effect: increased recidivism. Research supports that rehabilitation is most successful when sex offenders are integrated into the community. Instead, these laws may isolate these individuals and increase the risk for repeat offenses. The Louisiana legislation outlines just one of the many social stigmas tied to registration as a sex offender. If you or a loved one is charged with a sex crime, it is important to seek the counsel of an experienced sexual assault defense lawyer to protect your legal rights.

Cutting-edge research increasingly shows that the parts of the brain regulating risk taking and rational control are still not fully formed in teenagers. Holding juveniles to adult standards, then, is a very problematic policy. Fortunately, Connecticut has finally passed \"Raise the Age\" legislation to require young offenders under the age of 18 to have their cases heard in juvenile court and be segregated from adult prisoners. This article will discuss the likely impact of this law on Connecticut juvenile offenders . Juvenile Justice in Connecticut Historically, juvenile justice in the U.S. has been based on the principle that kids who commit offenses should not be punished in the adult system. The idea was that the focus of a separate juvenile system should be on rehabilitating youthful offenders. Over time, the demarcation between the two systems began to erode precipitously. As America ratcheted up its sentencing laws in the last 30 years, more and more juveniles have been tried as adults. This has not only included 16 and 17-year-olds, but also many kids even younger. Concern about the specter of 14-year-old kids in adult prisons finally helped push the pendulum back the other way. More and more states acted to re-establish that young people under the age of 18 should normally have their cases heard in juvenile court, not the adult system. By 2009, Connecticut was one of only three states to regularly subject 16 and 17-year-olds to the adult criminal system. But in 2010, Connecticut, too, began to change course. In that year, the state started to again treat 16-year-olds as juveniles. In July 2012, the reform went farther still. Connecticut became the 37 th state to pass a \"Raise the Age\" law. This law makes clear that juveniles under the age of 18 should generally have their cases decided in the juvenile system, not the adult one. Transfer to Adult System This does not mean that Connecticut juveniles can no longer be dealt with at all in the adult system. When there are charges of serious crimes, juveniles can still potentially have their cases transferred to the adult courts. This applies to Class A and B felonies. If your juvenile child is in trouble with the law, strong advocacy is vitally important. This is especially so if the charges potentially involve a transfer to the adult criminal system. An experienced defense lawyer can tackle the issues on your behalf and work to resolve the case justly within the law.

Recently, Justice Elena Kagan issued the unanimous decision for the court for one of the cases. The decision for the second case is expected later this year. Writing for the majority, Justice Kagan overturned the decision of the Florida Supreme Court and placed a certain degree of trust in the abilities of drug-detection dogs and their handlers. The case involves the right of Americans to be free from \"unreasonable searches and seizures ,\" as spelled out in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The facts of the case The case, Florida v. Harris, arose when a police officer pulled over a motorist who was driving a vehicle with an expired license plate tag. The law enforcement officer believed the driver was exhibiting strange behavior, possibly indicating he was under the influence of drugs. The officer asked to search the vehicle, but the driver refused. The police officer then used a drug-sniffing dog to determine whether there were substances inside the vehicle. The officer reported that the dog alerted to drugs near the driver's door. Consequently, the police officer conducted a search of the vehicle. Although the officer did not find any illegal substances in the car, he found materials used to manufacture methamphetamine. The dog had not been trained to detect the materials found in the vehicle. Nevertheless, the driver was convicted of a drug crime . The Florida Supreme Court later reversed the conviction, though, finding that there was not sufficient evidence of the dog's ability to detect drugs. The Florida high court provided a long list of information that should be provided to prove a dog's capabilities. The US Supreme Court's decision The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Florida Supreme's Court decision. Justice Kagan found that the police officer had probable cause to search the vehicle, based on the dog's alert. The decision stated that there was enough evidence of the dog's \"reliability in detecting drugs,\" based on \"training and testing records.\" The court held that the Florida Supreme Court's decision was \"inconsistent with the 'flexible, common-sense standard' of probable cause.\" Therefore, the dog's handler was not required to present all of the information set forth in the Florida high court's decision to prove the drug-sniffing dog's qualifications.

Why it is important to hire a criminal defense attorney Criminal matters are not simply reduced to innocence or guilt. The law is very complex. It is important that every defendant understand any pending charges and potential sentences associated with each offense. If a suspect does not fully comprehend the matter, this could compromise his or her case. The good news is that a criminal defense lawyer has a deep understanding of criminal law. Before a defendant steps in court, a lawyer can begin to work on the criminal case. For example, a lawyer might do any of the following before a suspect makes a first appearance: Challenge an arrest on the basis of probable cause. Make an argument for bail release. Negotiate with prosecuting attorneys in an attempt to reach a plea bargain. Determine the weaknesses and strengths of a matter. These options can be thoroughly explored by an experienced attorney. However, if one is not familiar with criminal law and does not regularly interact with judges, court personnel or prosecutors, it could be very difficult to gain the best possible outcome for the case. Ultimately, it is helpful to hire a criminal defense attorney as soon as you suspect that you may be in trouble. If you face very egregious charges, you definitely need legal support. It helps to have an attorney that has had experience handling the type of criminal matter that you are dealing with. For example, if you are confronting charges for extortion, you should retain a criminal defense attorney that has experience defending federal charges . In the end, you do not want to put your future on the line. A guilty conviction could have more repercussions than a simple sentence. Some repercussions of a crime stick with you for life. If you would like to work to lessen or eliminate the consequences of a criminal charge, take the time to speak with a local criminal defense attorney.

In the early 1980s, female drivers accounted for only about 10 percent of all DUI arrests nationwide. By 2011, however, women made up nearly 25 percent of all drunk driving arrests , according to the Federal Bureau of Intelligence. Meanwhile, the number of male drivers arrested for DUI has been in decline since 1995. While the reasons for this trend are not entirely known, experts theorize that several different factors could be contributing to the increasing rate at which women are being charged with driving under the influence. More female drivers Some observers contend that more females are being charged with DUI as a result of several societal changes that have occurred in recent decades. One likely factor, some say, is the simple fact that women today are driving more than in earlier generations. With a higher number of women working outside of the home, there are more women on the roads than in decades past, and therefore the potential for DUI charges is increased. In addition, while it was once typical for men to drive when couples went out together, it is now commonplace for women to do the driving. Stress and societal changes Another possible contributor to the growing DUI rate among women, some believe, is the stress that many of today's women face when struggling to balance the demands of numerous - and sometimes competing - roles. For many women, this may include managing a wide range of competing obligations, such as mother, working professional, homemaker, community member and, in many cases, caretaker for aging parents. Particularly in a slow economy, the task of juggling these numerous demands can be intensely stressful, which for some women may increase the likelihood of a DUI arrest. A study conducted by the Traffic Injury Research Foundation found a close correlation between stress and DUI arrests among female drivers. Of the 186 female DUI defendants who participated in the TIRF study, nearly all said they had been arrested shortly after a stressful life event such as divorce or the death of a family member. More than 75 percent also said they used one or more prescription medications for anxiety, depression or other disorders. Stricter DUI laws Today's DUI laws create a lower threshold for drivers to be considered legally intoxicated, which could also account for some of the increase in the female drunk driving rate in recent years. In the past, the blood alcohol content (BAC) threshold for DUI was set much higher than it is today, at 0.10 or even 0.15. Today, however, it is illegal in all states to drive with a BAC of 0.08 or higher. Although women generally tend to drink less heavily than men, they also typically require fewer drinks to reach the legal DUI limit. As a result of the stricter DUI laws that have been passed in recent decades, more women may face charges for exceeding the legal limit by a relatively small amount. Call a DUI defense lawyer if arrested If you or a loved one is arrested for driving under the influence, it is important to get help from a skilled DUI defense lawyer at the earliest opportunity. An attorney with experience in DUI defense can help protect your legal rights during all stages of the investigation and prosecution, and will work hard to obtain a favorable resolution to your case.

The individuals were arrested following a lengthy investigation and subsequent raid by authorities from the FBI, Bridgeport Safe Streets Task Force, Bridgeport Police Department and the Connecticut State Police Statewide Narcotics Task Force. The gang of individuals all face various drug, firearm, and theft related charges and several of the individuals face up to life in prison if convicted on those charges. The investigation and raid occurred after the local police and the FBI were notified of numerous reports and complaints involving the criminal activity that seems to center around the apartment complex. After substantiating the need for a raid, the local police in conjunction with the FBI, obtained a search warrant and raided the apartment building focusing on one apartment that seems to be the epicenter of illegal activity. During the raid, officers said that they found cocaine and heroin, various drug paraphernalia, jewelry, and firearms that were later revealed to have been stolen and connected to a string of recent robberies. In all, the authorities took 14 individuals into custody. All are still awaiting trial. While it is unclear if any of the individuals have an attorney, the various drug charges are serious and could mean life in prison for several of the individuals. However, even those individuals who face lesser charges would still be looking at a lifetime criminal record and a possibly lengthy prison sentence. However, a quality defense attorney would likely be able to help the individuals by ensuring the investigation and raid didn't violate constitutional rights, ensuring there were no issues such as entrapment or coercion. They may be able to help individuals obtain lesser charges and smaller prison sentences in trade for testimony or a guilty plea.

The changes ordered by Holder were specifically designed to circumvent harsh mandatory minimum sentencing rules, under which some first-time offenders received long, multi-year sentences. Many experts saw this move as a prudent first step in moving beyond policies set during the height of the federal government's war on drugs. Recently, a report has arisen indicating that federal prosecutors are still using the threat of harsh mandatory minimum sentences in cases involving drug trafficking and related crimes. Specifically, prosecutors appear to be using their discretion to bring charges that would carry mandatory minimum sentences as a means of coercing confessions from defendants who refuse to plead guilty. The report, written by the group Human Rights Watch, should come as no surprise. After all, prosecutors are likely to use whatever tools that are available to them to ensure a guilty plea or conviction. Nevertheless, the report is disheartening, particularly for those who applauded the Attorney General's initial decision to be more lenient in the charging of low level drug offenders. For its part, the Justice Department has reiterated its dedication to avoid filing sentencing enhancements against certain first-time, low level suspects. A statement by the Justice Department also said that it does not support the use of these sentencing enhancements as a means of securing a criminal confession. Critics of federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws have renewed calls to provide federal judges with greater leeway to deviate from sentencing guidelines. In many cases, judges develop a sense of what a proper sentence should be simply from getting to know the facts of the case. Some suggest that the Senate Judiciary Committee is likely to consider their options once Congress returns from recess. Some have also suggested that Attorney General Holder should provide further guidance to federal prosecutors regarding the use of mandatory minimum sentences as a tool for securing a confession. So far, the Attorney General has not spoken publicly about the matter. If you are facing investigation for drug trafficking or any other federal crime, it is imperative that you speak to an experienced criminal defense lawyer.

In most cases, a driver will face possible drunk driving charges in Connecticut if he or she is found to have an \"elevated\" blood alcohol content (BAC) while behind the wheel - defined under state law as a BAC of 0.08 percent or more. While police will typically conduct testing of a driver's blood, breath or urine in order to determine whether an elevated BAC exists, this testing must be conducted within two hours of driving under current Connecticut law. Generally, this two-hour limit is in place to help ensure that alcohol testing is as accurate as possible when assessing a driver's BAC. However, earlier this month, a bill was introduced in the Connecticut legislature that will, if passed, eliminate this important two-hour time limit in certain situations. Using BAC tests in a Connecticut court The admissibility of alcohol testing in criminal proceedings is a serious matter in Connecticut. Indeed, there are many safeguards provided under the law that must first be met before a court can even consider a BAC test, which include: The test must be conducted within two hours of the driver's operation of a motor vehicle The driver must be given a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney prior to testing, and he or she must consent to the test After the test results are known, a true copy of the results must be provided to the driver within 24 hours, or by the end of the next business day, whichever is later The testing must be performed by police in accordance with the methods prescribed and approved by the state The device used to conduct the testing must be checked for accuracy in accordance with state regulations An additional test must be conducted at least 10 minutes after the first test Importantly, as referenced earlier, the first safeguard - the two-hour time limit - will be eliminated if recently introduced Connecticut legislation is passed. In fact, this particular bill, House Bill 5586 , will permit alcohol test results to be admitted as evidence if not taken within two hours if it is demonstrated that the \"test results [...] accurately indicate the blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offense.\" Sadly, however, the text of the bill makes no mention as to how this burden of proof will be met, nor does it indicate how the proposed change will impact road safety. If anything, this new legislation merely proposes to strip away protections from those accused of drunk driving with no explanation - leaving more questions than answers. While it remains to be seen whether this bill will gain support, it certainly illustrates the uphill battle faced by many of those charged with drunk driving in Connecticut. Accordingly, if you have currently dealing with OUI/DUI charges, it is often best to seek the counsel of an experienced criminal defense attorney in order to learn your rights and options.

With certain limited exceptions, the Court's recent ruling establishes that warrantless cellphone searches by police are unconstitutional. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits police from conducting unreasonable searches and seizures. The exact meaning of \"unreasonable,\" however, depends on the circumstances. Search incident to arrest When a person is lawfully arrested - meaning that the arrest is supported by probable cause - police generally do not need a warrant to conduct an initial search of the suspect's vehicle or personal belongings, such as a backpack, purse or briefcase. This type of search, known as a search incident to arrest, allows officers to search for concealed weapons or other evidence of criminal activity that may be within the suspect's reach. It is thought to be reasonable because it helps protect officers' safety and prevent the destruction of evidence. Home searches In contrast, police are usually required to obtain a warrant before they can conduct a search of a person's home. This is because there is thought to be a higher expectation of privacy within the home than in a vehicle or in public. Thus, a police search of the home is thought to be more invasive and therefore requires a greater degree of justification to be considered reasonable. Except in emergencies and certain other limited circumstances, a police search of the home without a warrant is considered unreasonable and is therefore barred by the Fourth Amendment. Court says cellphone searches are highly invasive The central issue in the recent case was whether cellphone searches should be treated more like searches incident to arrest or home searches. The Court ruled unanimously for the latter. More than 90 percent of adults in the United States own cellphones, the Court reasoned in its written opinion, and these devices often contain digital records of nearly every aspect of the owner's life. Using the information contained on or accessible through a person's cellphone, such as emails, photographs, internet search records and other data, it is possible to reconstruct the owner's personal life in great detail. Thus, the Court concluded, cellphones deserve a higher degree of protection from police searches. Evidence obtained from illegal searches may be barred When police violate a person's constitutional rights by conducting an unlawful search, it is sometimes possible to stop any evidence discovered during that search from being used in court. If you have been arrested for a crime, be sure to talk to a lawyer to learn more about your rights and the options that are available to help protect your interests.

An ignition interlock is a small device that is wired into a vehicle's ignition system. The driver must blow into the device before starting the vehicle. If the ignition interlock detects a certain measurable amount of alcohol, the vehicle will not start. In Connecticut, installation of an ignition interlock device has already been required for some drivers convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. However, under a new bill recently signed by Governor Dannel Malloy, an ignition interlock will be required even for a first DUI offense . Ignition interlocks can be inconvenient and expensive Specifically, the new law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to take administrative action in requiring ignition interlock installation for first-time DUI offenders. While the law does reduce the mandatory license suspension period for some drunk driving violations, it will impose ignition interlock requirements at the conclusion of license suspensions. In the past, mandatory ignition interlocks were reserved in Connecticut for those believed to present a particular danger to other motorists. Now however, ignition interlocks will be required for DUI convictions and Department of Motor Vehicle Administrative Per Se Suspensions even if it is the offender's first time being in trouble with the legal system. Having to use an ignition interlock can obviously be embarrassing and inconvenient. But it can also be cripplingly expensive. Just to participate in Connecticut's ignition interlock program, you must pay a series of hefty fees to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Once your fees have been paid and your application approved, you must pay an ignition interlock vendor to install a device. After the ignition interlock is installed, you are responsible for maintenance costs and service fees from the vendor. Eventually, you will have to pay to have the ignition interlock removed. The new ignition interlock bill was signed into law on August 11 in a ceremony held on the front plaza of the Fairfield Police Department headquarters. The law goes into effect on July 1, 2015.

A third roommate was also located inside Soundview Hall, but the individual was outside of the dorm room where the altercation occurred. At the time of reporting, the man who was charged has not offered a plea, and a superior court judge has formally issued a no-contact order. Connecticut assault charges cover a range of incidents. Charges for first-degree assault can result in significant fines, probation or a lengthy prison sentence.

The crack cocaine seizure was believed to be the largest in Washington County history. The cash was reported to have amounted to more than $35,000 in cash. Two illegal guns were also confiscated. One of the individuals had been wanted for previous misdemeanor arrest warrants, including one for petit larceny. Prior to going to the home, state troopers secured a search warrant from the Queensbury Town Court. One of the individuals was previously arrested in Queensbury in 2011 for passing a counterfeit $100 bill at a McDonald's restaurant. She pleaded guilty to petit larceny. The two individuals were arrested at the scene, and they have both been charged with first-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance as well as third-degree possession and first-degree possession of marijuana. Weapons charges were also anticipated due. The first charge, first-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Both individuals are both being held at the Washington County Jail due to lack of bail. The Washington County sheriff's office, State Police Community Narcotics Enforcement Team and Greenwich Station state police were all involved in the investigation in this case.

The charges are related to alleged verbal threats of violence against Stratford and Danbury schools. Authorities said that they became aware of the alleged threats on March 3. None of the threats pertained to any schools in the Torrington area. According to Torrington school officials, a manifesto was discovered by police in the woman's home that outlined her plans. In addition, she was accused of attempting to purchase guns several days before the threats are alleged to have been made. On March 6, police announced that another person would be charged in relation to these accusations. He is a 19-year-old resident of Torrington. On March 6, he was being treated at a secure medical facility. Once he is released, he will be taken into custody and charged with first-degree conspiracy and criminal attempt to commit assault. The female teen's criminal record shows that she was taken into police custody before on suspicion of breach of peace, criminal trespass and simple trespass. On March 5, $300,000 bond was set during her appearance in Bantam Superior Court. In addition, the court forbade her from possessing any weapons or entering any school property. Her next court appearance was scheduled for March 28 in Litchfield Superior Court. In this case, it is unknown whether an attorney is representing the woman. If convicted, she could be facing heavy penalties, including prison time. A criminal defense attorney could help in any case involving violent crime by constructing a viable defense aimed at dismissal or a reduced sentence, depending upon the evidence.

Reports indicate that as part of a months-long investigation into the trafficking of narcotics on campus, the university officers obtained a search warrant. In the student's dorm room, university authorities claim to have uncovered significant amounts of crystal meth, PCP, heroin and psilocybin mushrooms as well as nearly 75 grams of marijuana, 488 individual doses of LSD and almost 1,800 individual doses of ecstasy. In addition to the drugs, the police also allegedly found about $4,700 in cash and several narcotic packaging items. Police filed 14 drug charges against the student, including running a drug factory. He was held in custody until Feb. 3 when he appeared in a Superior Court for an arraignment. The judge set his bail at $250,000, and he is scheduled to appear in court again on Feb. 21. When the student appears in court, his defense lawyer may ask that the prosecutors present the drugs for which the student is being charged. Because seized drugs are often transferred many times before being put in an evidence locker, they sometimes turn up missing. If this happens, the judge may dismiss or reduce the drug charges due to a lack of evidence.

Douglas reportedly had a verbal fight with his then-girlfriend before grabbing her by the neck and slamming her head into walls as he took her back to their hotel room. He was initially charged with second-degree strangulation as well as third-degree assault. A judge gave the 42-year-old six months of conditional discharge following his plea and ordered him to go to counseling after the alleged domestic violence incident. His former girlfriend said that she was disappointed in the outcome, having wanted Douglas charged and convicted of assault. At the time, she had said that she had not wanted the police involved and that she had a \"little fight\" with Douglas. A clerk had phoned the police after he saw bruises on her neck. The incident occurred on Sept. 22 at around 2:50 a.m. After speaking with police, the victim had gone to the hospital where she spoke more about what happened, revealing that after engaging in an argument with Douglas she had left the room. According to her account, he caught up with her at the elevator. She said she passed out from lack of oxygen and woke up in bed before running away. The prosecutor stated that her case was not a good one for trial because the woman had been drinking the night of the incident. A plea of no contest is neither an admittance of guilt nor a statement of innocence. In some cases, an attorney may suggest such a plea as part of an agreement for lessened penalties.

According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, the 30-year-old Holyoke man submitted a guilty plea in a federal court on Feb. 20 for his participation in 11 pharmacy robberies. On Oct. 4, 2013, a Walgreens on West Street in Cromwell, Connecticut, was robbed. Ten other pharmacies in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut were targeted between June 2013 and November 2013. The first known robbery occurred at a Rite Aid in Holyoke on June 19. In at least several of the robberies, it was said that a man showed the stores' staff members a handgun, then demanded that the store staff members give him prescription drugs that included oxycodone or OxyContin pills, a controlled substance. It is believed that thousands of pills were stolen over the course of several months. Criminal charges for violent crimes can result in a sentence of many years or even decades of imprisonment. If an identification made from security camera footage leads to charges being levied, it might be questioned whether the low resolution that such cameras normally provide could have made for a mistaken identity. A Connecticut criminal lawyer might also ask if any evidence was seized from the property of the accused with neither probable cause nor a valid search warrant; a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of the accused may allow for a reduction in charges.

The operation targeted the Dwight-Kensington and Fair Haven portions of New Haven, seeking those involved in gang violence and drug distribution. The investigation used wiretaps, surveillance and search warrants to gather evidence. In May 2012, over a hundred people were arrested as part of the operation. This resulted in the largest seizure of drugs and weapons in Connecticut history. One of the individuals detained in Operation Bloodline was a 28-year-old New Haven man. Drug charges were filed against him, both for conspiracy to possess heroin and conspiracy to distribute more than 100 grams of said heroin. He has now been sentenced to five years in prison for the crimes as well as four years of supervision post-release. A press release notes that the man has had prior convictions, including a guilty plea for stealing a firearm in 2004.

Police went to the Connecticut home of the two singers on the evening of April 27, resulting in charges of domestic violence . Brickell, age 47, allegedly started a shoving match after Simon, age 72, hurt her feelings. While this may seem like an immature and childish reason to pick a fight, the two have since patched things up. Neither appears to have been injured, and neither are asking for a restraining order. What is shocking to many people is that the couple has had no history of violence in their 20-year marriage, but they were still arrested. This is because new laws are in place to ensure that domestic violence cases are treated seriously. In the past, couples were separated for a few hours and then allowed to return home, which often allowed the violence to continue. This unfortunately led to fatalities, so now police in Connecticut and other states make arrests if they come to a home and there has been some sort of violence taking place. Domestic violence can often come with serious consequences, especially if there is a pattern of abuse. Will this recent scuffle lead to a damaged reputation for Brickell or Simon, or will fans simply laugh it off as one as life's crazy moments?

Instead of offering alcohol education programs for first-time offenders, ignition interlock devices will be installed instead. The House of Representatives voted in favor of this new bill, which would prevent offenders from not only driving while intoxicated, but also prohibit them from driving anyone else's car. An ignition interlock device is attached to the car's dashboard and prohibits the engine from starting until the person blows into a tube and registers a blood alcohol content under the legal limit. Some people might try to get around this requirement by having a friend or someone else blow into the tube. However, the technology is so advanced that the devices know if the person blowing into the tube is the right person. Some devices take photos. Drunk driving is a serious situation that can result in not only accidents, but injury and death. Many states have ignition interlock device laws in place, but they typically don't come into play unless the person is a repeat offender. Others may only require a device if they were caught intoxicated with a child in the car or of their BAC was more than twice the legal limit. Nobody wants to have their breath tested every time they want to start their vehicle, so it is hoped that once this law is passed, the number of DUI charges in the state will decrease.

She reportedly did not give provide any details regarding the issue, but she claimed that Simon shoved her and that she responded by slapping him. According to the police report, Brickell, who authorities believe may have been drinking, had a bruise on her wrist. Simon reportedly got a minor cut on his ear during the alleged incident. The couple has been married since 1992. They have three children. After the fight, Simon told the court they had had a fight, but that they were \"fine together\" and that the incident was \"very atypical.\" Simon's wife also reportedly indicated that she was not afraid of Simon. The prosecutors will be dropping the charges, and the accusations will be erased from the records in 13 months. The two seem to have largely moved on from the incident, but this case shows how courts can become involved even when neither party involved is pressing charges. Accusations of bodily injury or domestic violence can cause serious damage to a person's reputation even if the charges end up being dropped. It is important for defendants to understand their options as they navigate through the court process.

When a person is charged with a DUI , it is important for all of the events surrounding the incident to be taken into consideration. A Connecticut man is being charged with drunk driving after allegedly crashing into a parked car in the parking lot of Middlesex Hospital. The 48-year-old man was reportedly going to the hospital to check himself in to detox from alcohol. According to reports, a witness to the alleged accident confronted the 48-year-old, who later told police he had no memory of hitting the car. The responding officer reportedly asked the man if he had been drinking prior to the accident, and the man said that he \"had a few\" earlier that day. He was given a blood-alcohol test at the police station later, and the test reportedly showed blood alcohol levels of .270 and .247, four times Connecticut's legal limit of .08. The man was arrested on June 10 and was set to appear in court on June 11. Bail was set at $500. Charges of drunk driving often center around the results of a blood alcohol test, but even results that show a significantly higher level than that allowed by Connecticut law while driving may be able to be challenged, depending on how the test was conducted and whether or not the results are valid. Whether a defendant was properly advised of his or her Miranda rights before questioning can also be an important factor in how a drunk driving defense is approached.

According to reports, a SWAT team went in and raided the house in Bridgeport as part of a gang investigation before it was searched. Officers with the Statewide Urban Violence Cooperative Crime Control Task Force allegedly found two BB guns, six handguns and a total of 77 packets of heroin inside the residence. The investigation into the man had apparently been sparked after a gang was thought to be responsible for several shootings in the local area. The official charges against the man are illegal transfer of a firearm, possession of narcotics with intent to sell and risk of injury to a minor. The latter stems from the fact that there were apparently five young children in the home. The 19-year-old's bond was set at $250,000. In situations where drug charges stem from an investigation into organized criminal activity, such as a gang, the criminal defense strategy becomes even more important. Things that may factor into cases such as this one include whether the authorities had enough evidence to obtain a warrant, whether any search warrant present was executed properly and whether there were any other individuals inside the home at the time of the raid and search. Because charges related to organized crime and drugs are often aggressively prosecuted by authorities, it makes it all the more critical that defendants understand the court process, the charges against them and all of their defense options. Discussing the case with someone familiar with the agencies involved and the criminal trial process can help.

The incident occurred in West Hartford on a recent Saturday evening, a little before 10 p.m. According to police, after the woman hit the utility poles, she parked her vehicle in the front yard of a neighborhood home. Authorities say that three utility poles were knocked over and power was cut off in and around the intersection where the crash took place. Nearby streetlights and traffic signals were also shut down. Police say that the woman fled the scene of the crash, but officers later tracked her down and arrested her. Police say that the woman had a blood alcohol concentration of approximately .15 percent, which is almost twice the legal limit in Connecticut. She was booked on DWI charges. Fortunately, she did not suffer injury in the crash. A drunk driving arrest that follows a Connecticut car accident could be more severe than a drunk driving arrest that does not involve an accident. Not only could a convicted drunk driver be held criminally accountable and punished for the violation if convicted of the DUI crime, but he or she could also be held financially liable for any damages and/or injuries that arise from the crash. In this case, for example, if the man is convicted of DUI, any claims for civil restitution against him relating to city property damage could be strengthened by that conviction. For this reason, he may want to assert the strongest legal defense possible in order limit his chances of criminal conviction and being held financially liable.

Authorities report that the charges she was currently being held on were not related to the alleged murder and included a probation violation. According to reports, the 41-year-old man's body was found inside the Branford Motel, but it was not clear who originally found the body and notified authorities. The man had reportedly suffered a severe injury to his neck, and the cause of death was determined to be homicide. During the course of the investigation, officers were led to a business by unidentified evidence found at the hotel. At the business, located in close proximity to the hotel, there was video evidence of the man and 27-year-old woman together in the hours prior to his death. On July 7, authorities said that the woman would be arrested shortly on charges of larceny and murder. No proposed motive or additional information was released. Allegations of crimes are often reported in the media before the investigation is finalized or any persons charged. Because of this, defendants or even persons of interest in a criminal investigation may find themselves facing pressures and stigma from the community. All individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Those who are facing such charges or are at the center of an investigation can get a clearer understanding of the situations and options by speaking with an attorney experienced in criminal law.

According to reports, the woman told police that she came home on July 4 and found a watermelon with a butcher's knife in it on the counter. She then claims that the 49-year-old man came into the kitchen and started cutting the watermelon. The woman reportedly told authorities that she believed the man was trying to intimidate her, but police have made no mention of any allegations of physical assault. Another family member who was reportedly at the residence at the time of the alleged incident and saw the watermelon claimed that he did not see anything unusual and that it just appeared that the man had not had a chance to cut it up yet. The man was arrested on July 12 and charged with second-degree threatening and disorderly conduct. The Thomaston Police Chief defended the arrest, stating that it was the police's responsibility to look at all of the circumstances surrounding the situation and intervene if there was probable cause of criminal behavior. The woman apparently also told police that she found Percocet and marijuana among the man's belongings, but that did not result in any charges. At the July 14 arraignment, the judge issued a partial protection order, and the next court date is scheduled for Aug. 14. The man is expected to plead not guilty to the charges. As seen here, allegations of domestic violence , even in cases where there is no physical incident, can turn serious quickly. A conviction can have lifelong consequences for the defendant, including affecting future job opportunities and custody disputes. Defendants do have options, however, and understanding how the laws apply is the first step in mounting a criminal defense against accusations of domestic violence.

The teen's three friends were also detained, according to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Officers had initially come to the scene after reports of people swimming in the reservoir. One of the 15-year-old's friends was apparently among the swimmers. Officers issued the teen a warning. Authorities say that the four teenagers were riding the gas-powered vehicles on town roads and in the forest on July 16. Connecticut state law requires that motor scooter riders must be 16 years of age or older and have the proper licenses. Officers with DEEP reportedly called the 39-year-old man to come and pick up his son. However, when he arrived, officers believed he had been drinking and gave him a field sobriety test. Police claim the man failed both the field sobriety test and a subsequent Breathalyzer test. He was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and was released after posting a $500 bond. The next court date was scheduled for July 25. Driving while drinking is never a good idea, even when there are extenuating circumstances. However, everyone has lapses in judgment. To move forward from these types of events, it is important that defendants understand how alternative defense options, such as a plea bargain or challenging the results of a field sobriety test, may be applicable in certain cases.

Police reported that they then approached the 44-year-old's car, where a 30-year-old woman was sitting in the driver's seat. The woman was allegedly rolling a marijuana blunt when officers approached. Police searched the car and reported finding nine grams of marijuana with an approximate value of $100, 16 grams of cocaine worth a reported $600, $500 worth of heroin divided into 96 packets, multiple cellphones and cash in excess of $1,000. The two were arrested, and both are facing charges of possession of drugs in a school zone, possession with intent to sell and possession of heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Bond was set at $100,000 for each of them. In any situation where there are allegations of drug possession, the search and seizure procedure is of great interest to the defense. If officers do not follow the proper protocols or have probable cause for the search, it may be possible in some cases to have the evidence ruled inadmissible in court.

The man had been shot with a taser before he was stomped on. The charges say that this alleged attack was a violation of that man's rights, and a video of the incident has now surfaced. The officer who was arrested was a part of the Bridgeport Police Department. He had been working with that department for more than a decade. The attack in question happened back in 2011, though the man has just now been indicted. If he ends up being convicted of the charges, he could be put in jail for as long as 10 years. On top of that, he could have to pay a fine of as much as $250,000. Apparently, the whole incident began when two officers started chasing a suspect. They believed that he had a firearm. The suspect was in a van, but he jumped out of it and started running from the officers on foot. He ran into a park, and the officers used a taser to stop him. However, while it appears in the video that both of those officers were kicking the downed man., the officer who was arrested did not even show up until he was already down. He drove up in his squad car, got out and stomped on the man. Anyone who is facing criminal charges , no matter what they are accused of having done, has a right to a fair trial.

According to reports, the man was convicted of murder in 2011 after he was accused of fatally shooting another man outside of the Cardinal's Club on April 27, 2008. The now 26-year-old man has been serving time in the Cheshire Correctional Institution. In the appeal, his attorney argued that the court did not allow the defense to thoroughly cross-examine the police officers who testified during the trial, and the Appellate Court found that the original judge sustained several of the prosecution's objections during the officers' cross-examinations. The case will not go directly to trial, as now that the conviction has been overturned, the state must decide whether or not it will request the Appellate Court's ruling to be certified. If that happens, the case could go all the way to the Supreme Court. If the certifications request is not put in or the Supreme Court declines the case, it would then move forward to trial. This case provides an example of how the appeals process can be used successfully. The defense has the right to cross-examine witnesses in court as part of its strategy, and when the judicial process does not work as it should, it is important for defendants to understand their options after a conviction and have legal representation that can and will appeal the ruling if necessary. A new trial does not necessarily guarantee a different outcome, but it can give defendants another chance at a fair trial.

If physical documentation does exist, however, it can have serious implications for the defendants. Domestic violence charges commonly result from accusations of physical violence, but they can also be pressed if there are allegations of sexual, emotional or psychological abuse. Emotional and psychological abuse obviously are impossible to show with any kind of physical evidence, which is why they are often the hardest to prove and easiest to defend against. Many of these cases don't even make it to court because it is too difficult to show that the alleged abuse is severe enough to warrant criminal charges. When a person is accused of physically or sexually assaulting a spouse, partner or other family member, there may be documentation such as pictures taken by police, but this is not always true. It is well known that alleged domestic violence situations do not always involve a cooperative other party, and sometimes accusations do not come out until after any physical evidence that might have been there is gone. In some cases, domestic violence charges may be filed without physical proof if there are witness statements that corroborate the accusations or if there are medical records that suggest suspicious injuries. Domestic violence charges should also be taken seriously, even if the defendant is falsely accused. A conviction of this type can keep a person from working in certain industries and can impact any ongoing divorce or child custody situations.

In this state, drivers are considered over the legal limit if they are over the age of 21 with a blood alcohol content of .08 or above or under 21 with a blood alcohol content of .02 or above. Knowing the possible consequences can help drunk driving defendants get a better understanding of their cases and their options. Drivers in the state of Connecticut are considered to have given implied consent to be tested for alcohol while driving when they obtained their driver's licenses. This means drivers can immediately lose their licenses for six months if they refuse to take an alcohol analysis test, which can be a breath, urine or blood test. If a driver is tested and the blood alcohol level is above the legal limit, the penalties depend on how high the blood-alcohol content was and whether it is the person's first offense. There are two types of penalties that those convicted of drunk driving may be subjected to: administrative and criminal. For those over the age of 21, a blood-alcohol content over .08 means no license for a minimum of 90 days, and if the blood-alcohol content is over .16, the license is suspended for 120 days. Criminal penalties are applied from the state court system instead of the Department of Motor Vehicles, and these criminal penalties are in addition to any administrative penalties already imposed. A first offense can result in a one-year license suspension. A second offense also suspends the license for one year, but the driver must also have an ignition interlock device for the two years after the suspension. Drivers who are convicted of a third DUI may lose their licenses permanently. Serious charges mean serious penalties, and serious penalties mean the need for a solid defense strategy. Each case is unique, and discussing the possible options with an attorney experienced in representing those charged with DUIs can help those accused begin to move forward.

The need for a defense attorney doesn't stop once the jury hands down their decision; experienced representation can still be helpful during the sentencing phase of any criminal conviction. In general, a mandatory minimum penalty is the absolute least amount of jail time or smallest fine that the defendant can be subjected to in the case of a conviction. This means that the judge or jury have parameters already set forth for what sentence can be imposed. Not all crimes in the state of Connecticut carry mandatory minimum sentences, but many violent crimes do. The mandatory minimum sentence for a crime varies depending on the specific offense, and even those offenses within the same class do not always have the same minimums. Murder and first-degree kidnapping are both in the same felony class, for example, but the mandatory minimums differ. The mandatory minimum sentence for murder is 25 years in prison, while the mandatory minimum for first-degree kidnapping is only one year. First-degree assault is a lower class felony, carrying a mandatory minimum of 5 to 10 years in prison depending on the circumstances. Mandatory minimums are especially important to understand for those who are considering accepting a plea bargain, as defendants pleading guilty to a crime will face at least the minimum penalties. A well-informed decision includes understanding all possible outcomes, and someone experienced in the criminal defense of violent crimes is an excellent resource.

Defendants may have several different defense options depending on whether the charge was for possession or possession with intent to sell and whether or not it was a first offense. The first step to defending against a drug charge is to be fully informed on how Connecticut law applies to the individual's situation. Deputies with the Davidson Country Sheriff's Office Interstate Criminal Enforcement Unit arrested two Connecticut men on drug charges after a routine traffic stop on Sept. 19. According to reports, the two 37-year-old Hartford men were pulled over on Interstate 85 after deputies noticed the vehicle's tinted windows. The two men reportedly gave deputies their consent to search the vehicle. During the search, the deputies apparently found eight bags of the drug MDMA, a form of ecstasy also known as \"Molly,\" and digital scales. The two men were both charged possession of drug paraphernalia and possession with intent to sell and deliver a schedule I controlled substance. According to reports, one of the men was on probation related to another drug charge at the time of the arrest. United States residents have rights against illegal search and seizure and in most cases, an officer cannot search a vehicle without the person's consent. Any evidence that is obtained in a manner that violates the defendant's rights may be able to be thrown out and declared unusable in a trial. In cases involving drug possession, if the evidence found cannot be used in court, the case is often dismissed.
