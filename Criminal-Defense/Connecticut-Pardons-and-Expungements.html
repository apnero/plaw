<h3>Connecticut Expungement Process</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Connecticut, the expungement process allows you to seal records related to criminal charges so those records will not be visible to someone conducting a background check on you. If your records are expunged, you can answer &quot;no&quot; if you are asked on most employment or license applications if you have ever been charged with a crime.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Criminal records can be expunged three years after sentence completion for a
<a href="Misdemeanor-Crimes.html">misdemeanor</a> and five years after felony sentence is completed. Not all records can be expunged.
</p>
<h3>Connecticut Pardon Process</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles has discretionary authority to grant pardons for criminal convictions. A pardon is forgiveness of a crime, along with cancellation of any punishment such as a prison sentence. If you are pardoned for a crime, you can also obtain an expungement to seal records related to the charge.</p>
