<strong>What to Do if You Are Arrested in Connecticut</strong>
</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dealing with the police can be intimidating. Under our system of justice, you are considered innocent until you are proven guilty. However, police often bully defendants into providing interviews. Whether you think you are innocent or guilty of the charges, the risks of talking to police can be enormous.</p>
<p class="callOut" style="text-align:justify">At the law firm of Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, Attorneys at Law, we provide a
<strong>free initial consultation</strong> to discuss your case. We provide this consultation with no obligation to hire us to represent you. Call us at 203-583-8585. We defend people in and around Bridgeport, Connecticut.

<h3>Protecting Your Rights</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">When police contact you, they will not tell you everything they know about the case. They may even pretend to have information they don't have in order to pressure you into talking. The goal of the interview is simply to get you talking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">By the time police contact you in a criminal investigation, they are not looking for your side of the story. They are trying to obtain probable cause to arrest you. If you make statements in your defense, those statements can come back to haunt you and may even prevent you from using certain defenses. Innocent statements can be twisted around and interpreted to mean something that you never intended. In many criminal cases, police would not have had enough information to charge someone with a crime if that person did not provide incriminating evidence in an interview.</p>
<p>If you are contacted by police in Connecticut:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify"><li>Do not assume that you do not need an attorney because you are innocent. Many innocent people face
<a href="/Criminal-Defense/Criminal-Defense.html">criminal charges</a> and some are found guilty.
</li><li>Do not submit to an interview without a lawyer present.</li><li>Do not discuss the case with family or friends, as they may be forced to give testimony against you. Only information you tell your attorney is privileged.</li><li>If you think you may be arrested, contact an attorney as soon as possible.</li><li>If you are in custody, contact an attorney about bond.</li></ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our lawyers will thoroughly examine police reports, witness statements and all other evidence the state has against you. Then we will work with experts to build the most effective defense.</p>
