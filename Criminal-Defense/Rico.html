<h2>Understanding RICO Charges</h2>
<p>The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act was enacted to punish leaders of criminal enterprises for crimes committed under their orders. This includes mob bosses, gang leaders and union leaders. It can also include business people who have committed white collar crimes. </p>
<p>To be convicted under RICO, it must be shown that you committed, attempted or conspired to commit two of 35 state and federal crimes within a 10-year period. These 35 state and federal crimes include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="/Theft-Crimes/Embezzlement.html">Fraud and embezzlement</a>
</li><li>Robbery and other theft crimes</li><li>Gambling </li><li>
<a href="/Drug-Charges/Drug-Trafficking-Possession.html">Drug trafficking</a>
</li><li>Money laundering</li><li>
<a href="/Violent-Crimes/Homicide-Murder.html">Murder</a> and kidnapping

<a href="/Criminal-Defense/Federal-Charges.html">federal cases</a>, our Connecticut lawyers have the knowledge and resources to handle even the most complex RICO charges.

<h2>Civil RICO Cases</h2>
<p>In addition to criminal penalties, RICO allows civil liability for the defendant. A private individual can bring a claim against you for financial or property loss as a result of RICO-related activities. In this type of civil action, a plaintiff may be able to secure treble damages, which can be up to three times the amount of normal, compensatory damages. </p>
