You may also face a significant fine and court costs. In many cases, the collateral consequences of a misdemeanor conviction can be more serious than those imposed by the court.</p><p style="text-align:justify">If you are convicted of a misdemeanor, you will have a permanent criminal record that will be visible to future employers and anyone else who conducts a criminal background check on you. Certain misdemeanor convictions can limit your career choices and even result in the loss of civil rights. For example, if you are convicted of <a href="/Domestic-Violence/Domestic-Violence.html">domestic violence</a> assault, you will be barred by federal law from possessing firearms. If you are a police officer or security guard, you may lose your job. Many employers may not want to hire you if you are convicted of a crime such as <a href="/Theft-Crimes/Theft-Crimes.html">theft</a> or <a href="/Violent-Crimes/Assault.html">assault</a>.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Before you talk to police or accept any plea offer, discuss your case with an experienced criminal defense lawyer.</p><h3>We're Not Afraid to Challenge Evidence</h3><p style="text-align:justify">We believe in making the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. We are not afraid to challenge the police version of events or evidence that is obtained through illegal search and seizure.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Even if you think you are guilty of the charges, it may be possible to resolve the charges without a conviction.
