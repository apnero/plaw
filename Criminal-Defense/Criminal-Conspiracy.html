<h2 style="text-align:justify">Defending People in Connecticut Facing Conspiracy Charges</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Conspiracy is a criminal offense that may be charged when more than one person is involved in the alleged criminal actions. The potential consequences can be significant, since conspiracy is a separate crime that is charged in addition to the underlying offense.</p>

<p class="callOut">We offer a
<strong>free initial consultation</strong> to discuss your case. Call us at 203-583-8585.

<h3>What Is Criminal Conspiracy?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">In Connecticut, a person is guilty of conspiracy when he or she agrees with one or more persons to either engage in a crime or cause a crime to be committed. If any member of the group commits a crime, all members of the group can be charged with conspiracy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Conspiracy is often charged as an additional offense to
<a href="/Paoletti/Contact.html">drug charges</a> and white collar crimes.
</p>
<h3>Defenses to Criminal Conspiracy Charges</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">To convict you of conspiracy, the state must prove the following elements:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify"><li>There was an agreement between the defendant and one or more persons to commit the crime.</li><li>There was an overt act by any one of the defendants in furtherance of the agreement.</li><li>The defendant specifically intended to commit the crime.</li></ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our lawyers will examine all the evidence involved in your case. For example, the person charged with the underlying offense may be lying to obtain a more favorable deal from prosecutors. In reality, you may have never intended to join the conspiracy or may have withdrawn before any
<a href="/Criminal-Defense/Criminal-Defense.html">criminal acts</a> were committed. Our lawyers are willing and able to challenge any office the police have obtained.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Whatever your circumstances, we seek to achieve the best possible outcome in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
