Possession of child pornography is often charged in federal court, where sentencing guidelines call for a minimum of five years in prison. Depending on the number of images alleged to be in your possession and whether you are charged with production, you could face a much longer sentence. Even if you are charged in state court and are offered probation, you face the risk of lifetime registration as a sex offender.</p><p>The early involvement of an experienced defense attorney is essential to protect you from devastating consequences. There are many defenses in child pornography cases. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>The images are not pornography.</li><li>The images were downloaded on your computer by another person.</li><li>The images were inadvertently downloaded after you clicked on a deceptive link.</li></ul><p>Many young people face child pornography charges for images on cellphones. If you are accused of possessing images on your cellphone, it's important to talk to an experienced lawyer before you talk to police to avoid self-incrimination. </p><h2>Child Porn Defense Lawyers Serving Trumbull and Bridgeport</h2><p>The sooner you contact us, the more time we have to prepare your defense.
