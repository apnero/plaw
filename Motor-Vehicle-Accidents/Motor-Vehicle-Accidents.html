					<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Car-Truck Accident Lawyers in Bridgeport, CT</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you have suffered a whiplash/soft tissue injury or have lost a loved one in a Connecticut auto accident caused by someone else's negligence, you can recover compensation for your emotional, physical and financial injuries. Unfortunately, insurance companies tend to make even simple car accident claims difficult, lowballing settlement offers and denying valid claims in order to protect their bottom lines.</p>

We have more than 50 years of combined experience as trial lawyers and an extensive track record of legal success. For a no-cost, no-obligation consultation, please contact us online or call 203-583-8585.</p>

				<h3>
					<strong>Recovering Just Compensation</strong>
				</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">After an accident, many people assume that they will be able to recover compensation for their past medical bills and damage to their vehicles, but there is more to the picture than that. For example, if you have been seriously injured and will need rehabilitation, those costs may also be covered by insurance. You may also be able to recover for pain and suffering, loss of income caused by the accident, funeral expenses, and other economic and noneconomic damages suffered from the collision.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">An attorney can help you understand and fight for what you are entitled to under Connecticut personal injury law.</p>
				<h3>Holding the Negligent Driver Accountable</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The driver who caused you harm should be held responsible, whether he or she was driving drunk, texting while driving, falling asleep at the wheel, speeding or simply a bad driver. Our attorneys can help you provide evidence to show who was at fault in the car accident and, in some cases such as drunk driving cases, recover punitive damages that punish the driver for his or her actions.</p>
