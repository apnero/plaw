The reality is that passengers may suffer the same types of injuries as drivers in motor vehicle accidents. This includes:</p><ul style="text-align:justify"><li><strong>Head injuries:</strong> Front seat passengers may hit their heads on the dashboard and suffer head injuries or brain damage. Passengers' heads may also collide with windows. </li><li><strong>Spine injuries:</strong> After a rear-end collision or another type of auto collision, passengers may suffer back injuries that include damage to the spinal cord. </li><li><strong>Broken bones:</strong> Passengers riding anywhere in a car may suffer broken arms from attempting to reach out and brace themselves for the impact. Broken legs and other broken bones are common as well after auto accidents. </li></ul><h2 style="text-align:justify">Who Caused The Injuries To The Passenger?</h2><p style="text-align:justify">If the <a href="Car-Accidents.html">car accident</a> was caused by the negligent driver of another vehicle, legal action will target that driver. However, in some cases, the driver of the vehicle the passenger was in may have caused the accident or contributed to the accident. This may be a friend or family member, so the victim may be hesitant to move forward with legal action. It is important to understand that the true target of legal action is the driver's insurance company.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Depending on the nature of the car accident, legal action may target both drivers. Ultimately, our lawyers are committed to getting fair compensation for the passenger victim.</p><h2 style="text-align:justify">Contact Our Connecticut Passenger Injury Attorneys</h2><p style="text-align:justify">Want to learn more <a href="Steps-to-Take-if-You-re-Involved-in-a-Car-Accident.html">steps to take after you're involved in a car accident</a> or about recovering compensation after a passenger injury?
