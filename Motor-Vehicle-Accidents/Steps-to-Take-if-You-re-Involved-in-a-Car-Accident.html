					<p>The average person will be in a car accident once every 18 years. Yet, that statistic doesn't make car accidents any less complicated.

You may even need to work through the difficult emotions and financial challenges that come with serious physical injuries or the death of a loved one. </p>
				<p>The confusion, frustration, depression and anger can be overwhelming. Determining what to do next can seem like an insurmountable task.</p>

				<h2>Five Steps to Take After a Car Crash</h2>
				<p>So what should you do after a car crash? The answer to this question depends on your physical state and the facts surrounding your car accident. Here are five initial steps you can take to help your car accident claim:</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1) Document the accident.</strong> If you are relatively unharmed, document the accident by: 
				</p>
				<ul><li>Taking pictures of the accident scene, including your car, the other person's car and any damage on the ground</li><li>Taking down the names and numbers of any witnesses to the accident</li><li>Exchanging insurance information, names, numbers and license plate numbers with the other driver(s)</li></ul>
				<p>
					<strong>2) Seek medical attention.</strong> No matter what your injuries, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. This is true even if you feel you will heal on your own. Many symptoms of potentially lifelong injuries do not appear until weeks, even months after an accident. By getting medical help now, you can start the healing process sooner and secure the compensation you need to get appropriate medical care for your injuries. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>3) Call the police. </strong>No matter how much property damage or how great the injuries in a car accident, it is a good idea to call the police. They will document your accident for legal purposes × documentation that could help your accident claim. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>4) Call your insurance company. </strong>Let your insurance company know that the accident occurred, but make sure to steer clear of any discussions about fault or how the accident happened. Insurance companies like to pry information out of people before they have the facts themselves. Answer "who," "what," "where" and "when," but let your attorney investigate your accident and provide your insurance company with the "how." 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>5)</strong>
					<strong>Seek legal help. </strong>Many people choose not to seek legal help after a 
					<a href="/Motor-Vehicle-Accidents/Car-Accidents.html">car crash</a> because they don't think the cost of legal representation is worth it. Yet, by talking to an attorney, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain. At Paoletti &amp; Gusmano, we offer free consultations with no obligation to hire us. During our consultation, we will discuss your case and your options for recovering compensation. 
				</p>
				<p>Remember: insurance companies care about their bottom lines more than your financial security. Their first settlement offers never cover the full extent of their insured's injuries. Let us help you get full and fair compensation. Call our experienced car accident lawyers at
