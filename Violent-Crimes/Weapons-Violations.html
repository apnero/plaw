<strong>Carrying a concealed weapon:</strong> Certain weapons — including handguns — are legal to own, but you cannot carry them without a permit.
</li><li>
<strong>Felon weapon possession:</strong> If you have been convicted of a felony criminal offense, or one of a list of certain misdemeanors, including domestic violence offenses, within the past 10 years, it is illegal for you to possess or carry any type of firearm.
